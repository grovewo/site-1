The bus station in Chiang Mai has departures every half hour going north. They start at 05:30 and end at 17:30. We bought tickets to Chiang Dao and it cost us 40 baht each.
The bus was a very hot tin box, though there were fans and it seemed the Thais had maintained the bus well. The ride was solid. If you are planning to take this bus, be prepared to travel like tinned sardines.

Arriving in Chiang Dao we are immediately greeted by taxi drivers that knew exactly what a farang like me was in town for.
The price is 150 baht per truck, so don't let them fool you into seperate trucks like they did with our group.

20 minutes later we arrive at the festival. Immediate impressions were good, it seemed very homey, friendly and low-key. They raised the price to 200 baht per person, per day for this year.
150 baht to rent a tent, which only ended up using for our backpacks. We slept in our hammocks for the two nights, it was very cold at night. We had heard this and thought our tough Canadian blood could handle it.
We have been in Thailand too long for that because we had a very hard time sleeping both nights. You will need a sleeping bag.

Pictured above you'll see where we hung our hammocks. It's a dedicated area for hammock sleepers. There was plenty of space the whole time we were there. Not so much for tents.
On the second day, I witnessed a newcomer attempting to hang his hammock and watched as he pulled a whole section of rotten supports down.. oops.
I don't think this will be the same timber next year, if it is here at all.

The best part of our Shambhala In My Heart experience was the hot springs! They were so lovely and situated beside a cool river. These are public hotsprings maintained by the Japanese and Thai villagers that are very near by.
Respect is very important and I would recommend limiting your nudity and noise making.
It was so nice to have a hot bath after traveling on the bus all day, and the cool river was very refreshing.
We saw a group of buffalo cross the river too and it was quite a serene natural sight. Just don't be down river from these guys when they cross...

Every shop took great pride and care in making coffee. The place I liked the best by far though was HoklHong Cafe.
They had a little setup beside the yoga area. I bought a bag of their awesome coffee which they ferment with hops flowers before roasting.
The taste lacked bitterness and the fruity flavour of the coffee was apparent. The hops were incredibly subtle. This coffee did not make my heart pound like usual.
I have heard they make a cold brew version that is very hoppy. I try to get some while I am still in Chiang Mai.
We spotted him a lighter so he was kind enough to reciprocate with a cup of Thai Tea, which was very unique and the lady did enjoy.
Also enjoyed a piece of apple pie from them on our last day with our last coffee. Delightfully tart and not too sweet.

There were many handmade goods available there and it was a delight to have our pick of gifts to bring home for friends and family.
I much prefer genuine handmade products to the ubiquitous Thai themed trinkets. We bought a bamboo lamp, and some raw mustard flower honey from nepal.
My favourite snack was the "Fried Sandwich". A slice of bread wrapped around a filling, breaded and deep fried. Mmmmm.

I had a lovely time, it was very relaxing to get out of the city. There were all kinds of workshops going on and we participated in none of them.
Some great live performances too like one we saw as we were walking past and had to stay to watch seemed like this Japanese guy was controlling this girl with his voice and hands
in a very bewitched kind of long black haired droopy way. Easy to poke fun at and also very enchanting at the same time.

This is a relaxed festival that definately deserves your attention and you'll have plenty of time to check it out as it goes for 10 days! In 2018 it went from February 8th till the 17th.
