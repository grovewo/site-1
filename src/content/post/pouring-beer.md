It was familiar for me to pour my beers the advertised way. You know, with the glass tilted and the beautiful brew slinking quietly along the side, with nary a sign of the beers true nature. I, as I suppose many have been, part of a culture that praises this method of pouring beer as "the perfect pour". That anything less than this is either laziness or noob.

I suppose if you like to feel bloated after each beer, that method will work wonders for you. I have been let on to a different sort of pour.

#Pouring with vigor!


As I begin to pour, I hold the glass at a slight angle. I let the beer hit the side of the glass with zest and at once let the glass sit square, as I continue, witnessing the dramatic foaming effect and relishing another instance where I get to practice timing the rise of the foam.

Pouring over ice increases nucleation, releasing more CO2 and allowing the beer to sit bloat-free in your gut. I love that I can open my beer while it is still warm in this way. The ice also reduces the alcohol concentration, reducing the chances you might 'blow over'.

That's enough for now, I've got a semi-warm one to get at.

Cheers
