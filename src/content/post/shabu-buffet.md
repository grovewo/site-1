Today was the third time I've been to Shabu Buffet in Chiang Mai.
The first time we found this place, it was 6 PM and there was a line of asian folk waiting to get in. Still, the turnaround was ok and we got in after about 20 minutes.
This time we were early and I noticed half way through our meal that we had not spotted one farang present at this hot pot buffet for all three times we had been to Shabu.
This must be a real hot spot for the locals, and indeed, it did seem to be the hip joint with mostly Thai youth present.

The food was quite basic, and that is part of the charm. There was two styles of broth on the table for cooking your food items in.
One broth was a Japanese soy sauce style broth. The other was a salty herb broth. Both were very tastfully made and gained awesome flavour as we cooked our meats and vegetables in the broth.
We decided to add some garlic and green onion to the herb broth this time and this really boosted the flavour.
There were fountain drinks available for 49 Baht, though we opted for the filtered water. There are also trays of thinly sliced cuts of fatty pork belly available for purchase but we did not indulge.
The buffet costs 199 Baht per person, and for that you get great value as the boiled vegetables digest quickly and easily. I leave feeling full, but not overstuffed.
The option to finish everything off with some green tea or coconut icecream was a welcome treat.

I will be back.
